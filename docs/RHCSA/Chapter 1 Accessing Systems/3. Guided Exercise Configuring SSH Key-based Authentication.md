## Guided Exercise

# Configuring SSH Key-based Authentication

!!! Before you begin
    1. Clone your VM into `servera` and `serverb`
    2. Change `servera` hostname into `servera` and `serverb` hostname into `serverb`
    ```
    [rehan@localhost ~]$ su -
    Password:
    [root@localhost ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname servera
    ```
    ```
    [rehan@webserver ~]$ su -
    Password:
    [root@webserver ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname serverb
    ```


    3. Create user `operator1` by password `redhat` on `servera` and `serverb`
    ```
    [root@servera ~]# useradd operator1
    [root@servera ~]# passwd operator1
    Changing password for user operator1.
    New password: redhat
    BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
    Retype new password: redhat
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
    ```  
    ```
    [root@serverb ~]# useradd operator1
    [root@serverb ~]# passwd operator1
    Changing password for user operator1.
    New password:
    BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
    Retype new password:
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
    ```
    4. Create user `student` on `serverb`
    ```
    [root@serverb ~]# useradd student
    [root@serverb ~]# passwd student
    Changing password for user student.
    New password: 1234
    BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
    Retype new password: 1234
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
    
1. From your `windows cmd`, open an SSH session to serverb as student
```
C:\Users\Monk>ssh rehan@your_ip_address
```

2. Use the `su` command to switch to the `operator1` user on `serverb`. User `redhat` as the password of `operator1`
```
[student@serverb ~]$ su - operator1
Password:
[operator1@serverb ~]$
```  

3. Use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate SSH keys. Do not enter a passphrase.
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/operator1/.ssh/id_rsa): enter
Created directory '/home/operator1/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): enter
Enter same passphrase again: enter
Your identification has been saved in /home/operator1/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/operator1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```  
4. Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to send the public key of the SSH key pair to `operator1`
on `servera`. Use `redhat` as the password of `operator1` on `servera`.  
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh-copy-id operator1@servera_ip_address
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/operator1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.5 (192.168.1.5)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:Xbp9Sh3L8OwG1pj62suEtSTM2CuJvcAty0GAaVdouHE.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
operator1@192.168.1.5's password: redhat
```
  
5. Execute the `hostname` command on `servera` remotely using SSH without accessing the
remote interactive shell.
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh operator1@servera hostname
servera
```
Notice that the preceding ssh command did not prompt you for a password because it
used the passphrase-less private key against the exported public key to authenticate as
operator1 on servera. This approach is not secure, because anyone who has access
to the private key file can log in to servera as operator1. The secure alternative is to
protect the private key with a passphrase, which is the next step.  

6. Use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate another set of SSH keys with passphraseprotection. Save the key as `/home/operator1/.ssh/key2`. Use `redhatpass` as the
passphrase of the private key  
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh-keygen -f .ssh/key2
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): redhatpass
Enter same passphrase again: redhatpass
Your identification has been saved in .ssh/key2
Your public key has been saved in .ssh/key2.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:sZJuY84PaRxyW87F501M0mwTlVAWDXbtgV9fe9goi9E operator1@serverb
The key's randomart image is:
```
7. Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to send the public key of the passphrase-protected key
pair to `operator1` on `servera`.
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/key2.pub operator1@servera
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: ".ssh/key2.pub"The authenticity of host 'servera (172.16.70.27)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:Xbp9Sh3L8OwG1pj62suEtSTM2CuJvcAty0GAaVdouHE.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:1: 192.168.1.5
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:4: 172.16.70.27
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'operator1@servera'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.  
```
8. Execute the `hostname` command on `servera` remotely with SSH without accessing the
remote interactive shell. Use `/home/operator1/.ssh/key2` as the identity file. Specify
`redhatpass` as the passphrase, which you set for the private key in the preceding step.  
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh -i .ssh/key2 operator1@servera hostname
Enter passphrase for key '.ssh/key2':
servera
```  
Notice that the preceding `ssh` command prompted you for the passphrase you used
to protect the private key of the SSH key pair. This passphrase protects the private key.
Should an attacker gain access to the private key, the attacker cannot use it to access other
systems because the private key itself is protected with a passphrase. The ssh command
uses a different passphrase than the one for `operator1` on `servera`, requiring users to
know both.  
You can use `ssh-agent`, as in the following step, to avoid interactively typing in the
passphrase while logging in with SSH. Using `ssh-agent` is both more convenient and more
secure in situations where the administrators log in to remote systems regularly.    
9. Run `ssh-agent` in your Bash shell and add the passphrase-protected private key (`/home/
operator1/.ssh/key2`) of the SSH key pair to the shell session.  
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ eval $(ssh-agent)
Agent pid 1873
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh-add .ssh/key2
Enter passphrase for .ssh/key2: redhatpass
Identity added: .ssh/key2 (operator1@serverb)
```   
10. Execute the `hostname` command on servera remotely without accessing a remote
interactive shell. Use /home/operator1/.ssh/key2 as the identity file  
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh -i .ssh/key2 operator1@servera hostname
servera
```  
Notice that the preceding ssh command did not prompt you to enter the passphrase
interactively.    
11. Open another terminal on `CMD` and open an SSH session to `serverb` as `student`
```
C:\Users\Monk>ssh student@serverb_ip_address
student@172.16.70.23's password: 1234
```
12. On `serverb`, use the su command to switch to `operator1` and invoke an SSH connection
to `servera`. Use `/home/operator1/.ssh/key2` as the identity file to authenticate
using the SSH keys.  
``` 
[student@serverb ~]$ su - operator1
Password: redhat
```
```
[operator1@serverb ~]$ ssh -i .ssh/key2 operator1@servera
Enter passphrase for key '.ssh/key2': redhatpass
Last login: Wed Jul 24 10:02:16 2024 from 172.16.70.23
[operator1@servera ~]$
```  
Notice that the preceding `ssh command` prompted you to enter the passphrase
interactively because you did not invoke the SSH connection from the shell that you
used to start `ssh-agent`.  
13. Exit all the shells you are using in the second terminal. 
```
[operator1@servera ~]$ exit
logout
```
